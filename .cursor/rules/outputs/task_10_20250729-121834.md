# Görev: Sprint 5 - Süpervizör paneli dashboard tasarımı

For Sprint 5, I understand that you want me to design a Supervisor panel dashboard. Here's a suggested design:

**Dashboard Overview**

The Supervisor panel dashboard should provide an overview of the entire system, allowing the Supervisor to quickly identify any issues or areas requiring attention.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

1. **System Status**: A simple traffic light system indicating whether the system is functioning normally, experiencing issues, or down.
2. **Availability Percentage**: The percentage of time the system has been available and functional during the current sprint.
3. **Error Rate**: The number of errors encountered during the current sprint, displayed as a graph or chart to show trends.
4. **Uptime**: The total uptime for the system during the current sprint, expressed in hours, days, or weeks.

**Supervisor Tasks**

1. **Alerts Panel**: A panel displaying any alerts or issues that require attention from the Supervisor.
2. **System Configuration**: A section where the Supervisor can make configuration changes to optimize system performance.
3. **User Management**: A panel for managing user accounts, roles, and permissions.

**Visualization Components**

1. **System Map**: A visual representation of the system architecture, showing connections between components.
2. **Error Heatmap**: A heatmap displaying error rates across different components or regions of the system.
3. **Resource Utilization Graphs**: Charts showing resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space) for individual components or the entire system.

**Quick Actions**

1. **Troubleshoot Issues**: A button to initiate a troubleshooting process for identified issues.
2. **Restart System Components**: A button to restart specific system components that are experiencing errors or performance issues.
3. **Alerts Log**: A link to view detailed logs of alerts and issues.

**Design Guidelines**

To ensure the dashboard is intuitive and easy to use:

1. Use a clean, minimalistic design with clear headings and labels.
2. Utilize standard colors and fonts throughout the dashboard.
3. Ensure sufficient whitespace and padding for readability.
4. Incorporate icons and graphics judiciously to convey information effectively.

**Additional Features**

1. **Customizable Views**: Allow Supervisors to create custom views or dashboards based on their specific needs.
2. **Notifications**: Implement a notification system that alerts the Supervisor when new issues arise, allowing for prompt attention.
3. **System Auditing**: Include features for auditing and logging system changes, ensuring accountability and transparency.

Please let me know if this design meets your expectations or if you'd like to make any changes!
