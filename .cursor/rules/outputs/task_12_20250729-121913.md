# Görev: Sprint 5 - White-label yapı için regionConfig.ts sistemi

For Sprint 5, it seems like you're working on a white-label system for configuring regions in your application. That's exciting!

To clarify, `regionConfig.ts` is a TypeScript file that contains configuration settings for different regions in your application. Am I correct?

In this context, what specific requirements or features do you need to implement in `regionConfig.ts`? Are there any specific regional configurations, like language support, time zones, or currency formats, that you need to accommodate?

Please share more details about the expected functionality and any challenges you're facing while implementing it. I'm here to help!
