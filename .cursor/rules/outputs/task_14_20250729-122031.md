# Görev: Randevu modülü: tarih-saat picker, Firestore'da saklama, no-show uyarısı

You want to create a "Randevu" (appointment) module with the following features:

1. **Date-Time Picker**: Allow users to select a date and time for their appointment.
2. **Firestore Storage**: Store the appointment data in Firestore, a NoSQL database by Google.
3. **No-Show Warning**: Send a notification or warning to the user if they miss their scheduled appointment.

Here's a high-level overview of how you can implement this module:

**Date-Time Picker**

* Use a JavaScript library like Moment.js or a UI component from a framework like React or Angular to create a date-time picker.
* Allow users to select a date and time for their appointment.
* Store the selected date and time in a variable, which will be used to schedule the appointment.

**Firestore Storage**

* Set up a Firestore database with a collection (e.g., "appointments") to store the appointment data.
* Define a document structure for each appointment, including fields like:
	+ `date` (timestamp)
	+ `time` (string or timestamp)
	+ `user_id` (reference to the user's ID in another Firestore collection)
	+ `status` (e.g., "pending", "confirmed", "canceled")
* Use the Firebase SDKs for your chosen platform (e.g., React, Angular) to interact with Firestore.

**No-Show Warning**

* Set a timer or use a scheduling library like Schedule.js to trigger a notification after a certain time period has passed since the appointment was scheduled.
* Send a notification to the user's phone or email using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Google Cloud Messaging (GCM).
* Alternatively, display a warning message on the user's dashboard or in-app messaging system.

Here's some sample code to get you started:
```javascript
// Import necessary libraries
import * as firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'moment-timezone';

// Set up Firestore database
const db = firebase.firestore();

// Define appointment document structure
const appointmentDoc = {
  date: moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
  time: moment().format('HH:mm:ss'),
  user_id: '', // Replace with actual user ID
  status: 'pending'
};

// Create a new appointment in Firestore
db.collection('appointments').add(appointmentDoc).then((docRef) => {
  // Store the document reference for later use
  const appointmentId = docRef.id;
});

// Set up no-show warning timer (e.g., after 1 hour)
setTimeout(() => {
  // Send notification to user (using FCM/GCM or in-app messaging)
  console.log('No-show warning sent!');
}, 3600000); // 1 hour in milliseconds
```
This is just a starting point, and you'll need to customize the code to fit your specific requirements. Good luck with your project!
