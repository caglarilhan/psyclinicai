# Görev: Supervizör paneli: AI değerlendirme + seans süresi analizi

A supervisory panel for AI evaluation and session duration analysis!

Here's a potential design for the supervisory panel:

**Panel Components**

1. **AI Model Performance Metrics**:
	* Accuracy
	* Precision
	* Recall
	* F1 Score
	* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
	* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. **Session Duration Analysis**:
	* Average session duration
	* Median session duration
	* Standard deviation of session duration
	* Histogram of session durations
3. **AI Model Evaluation**:
	* Confusion matrix (correctly/incorrectly classified instances)
	* ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic)
	* Precision-Recall Curve
4. **Additional Insights**:
	* Top-performing AI models (based on performance metrics)
	* Worst-performing AI models (based on performance metrics)
	* Session duration distribution by AI model

**Panel Layout**

The panel can be divided into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the AI evaluation and session duration analysis. Here's a possible layout:

**Section 1: AI Model Performance Metrics**

* A table displaying the performance metrics for each AI model
* A bar chart or radar chart showing the relative performance of each AI model

**Section 2: Session Duration Analysis**

* A histogram showing the distribution of session durations
* A line graph showing the average and median session duration over time (if applicable)
* A scatter plot showing the relationship between session duration and AI model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy vs. session duration)

**Section 3: AI Model Evaluation**

* A confusion matrix for each AI model
* ROC curve and Precision-Recall Curve for each AI model

**Section 4: Additional Insights**

* A table listing the top-performing AI models based on performance metrics
* A table listing the worst-performing AI models based on performance metrics
* A bar chart showing the distribution of session durations by AI model

**Interactive Features**

To make the panel more interactive and informative, you can add features such as:

* Hover-over text or tooltips providing additional information about each metric or graph
* Drill-down capabilities to explore specific aspects of the data (e.g., individual AI models' performance metrics)
* Filtering options to focus on specific subsets of data (e.g., only consider sessions with certain characteristics)

**Design Considerations**

When designing the supervisory panel, keep the following considerations in mind:

* Ensure the panel is easy to navigate and understand
* Use clear and concise labeling for each metric and graph
* Provide sufficient white space to avoid visual clutter
* Make sure the panel is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices

By incorporating these design elements and features, the supervisory panel can provide a comprehensive and insightful view of AI model performance and session duration analysis, helping you make data-driven decisions and optimize your AI-powered systems.
