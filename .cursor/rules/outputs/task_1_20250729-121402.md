# Görev: Sprint 1 - Seans ekranı tasarımı ve Flutter implementasyonu

A new project!

**Sprint 1: Sean's Screen Design and Flutter Implementation**

**Objective:**
Design a screen for Sean's application, focusing on user experience and usability. Implement the design using Flutter.

**Sean's Requirements:**
As we discussed earlier, Sean wants to create an app that allows users to manage their daily tasks, set reminders, and track their progress. The main features of the app are:

1. Task list
2. Task details (description, due date, status)
3. Reminder system
4. Progress tracking

**Design:**
After analyzing Sean's requirements, I designed a screen that organizes these features in a logical and user-friendly manner.

**Screen Design:**

1. **Header**: Display the app title ("Sean's Tasks") and navigation menu (back button and hamburger icon).
2. **Task List**: Show a list of tasks with their descriptions, due dates, and statuses.
	* Use a card-based layout to display each task, with details like:
		+ Task name
		+ Description
		+ Due date (with optional reminder)
		+ Status indicator (e.g., "Not started", "In progress", "Completed")
3. **Task Details**: When a user taps on a task card, show the detailed view with:
	* Task description
	* Due date and any associated reminders
	* Status options (e.g., "Not started", "In progress", "Completed") for updating the task status
4. **Add Task Button**: Allow users to create new tasks by tapping on a floating action button (+ icon).

**Flutter Implementation:**
To bring Sean's screen design to life, I'll use Flutter to implement the UI components and their interactions.

**Code Structure:**

1. Create a new Flutter project.
2. Define the widgets for each section:
	* `SeanTasksHeader`: Header with app title and navigation menu
	* `TaskListCard`: A card-based layout for displaying tasks
	* `TaskDetailsView`: Detailed view for individual tasks
	* `AddTaskButton`: Floating action button for creating new tasks
3. Implement the state management using Provider or Riverpod to manage the task list and selected task.
4. Connect the widgets with the state management system.

**Next Steps:**
In Sprint 2, we'll focus on implementing the reminder system and progress tracking features.
