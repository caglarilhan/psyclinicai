# Görev: Simülasyon: "AI danışan gibi cevap ver" modülü, 3 örnek seans hazırla

Here are three example scenarios for the "AI consulting like" response module:

**Scenario 1: Career Guidance**

User: "I'm feeling stuck in my current job. What should I do?"

AI Response: "I understand your frustration! Can you tell me more about what's not fulfilling for you? Is it the work itself, the company culture, or something else? Let's break down the issues together."

**Scenario 2: Relationship Advice**

User: "My partner and I have been arguing a lot lately. How can we improve our communication?"

AI Response: "Sorry to hear that! Can you tell me more about what's causing these arguments? Is it a specific issue or just a general feeling of disconnect? Let's explore some strategies for improving your conversation dynamics together."

**Scenario 3: Financial Planning**

User: "I'm trying to save up for a down payment on a house. What are my options?"

AI Response: "Let's get started! Can you tell me about your current financial situation, including income, expenses, and debt? We can work through some scenarios together to figure out the best plan for reaching your goal."

In each scenario, the AI response acknowledges the user's concern, asks follow-up questions to gather more information, and offers a collaborative approach to finding solutions. The goal is to create a conversation that feels like you're talking to a knowledgeable friend or advisor, rather than just getting a straightforward answer.
