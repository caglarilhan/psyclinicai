# Görev: Slack benzeri kurum içi mesajlaşma + AI özetleme sistemi

You're looking for a system that combines the features of an internal messaging platform like Slack with AI-powered summarization capabilities. This sounds like an exciting project!

Here's a potential concept:

**Internal Messaging Platform:**

1. Create a web-based or mobile app-based platform for employees to communicate and collaborate.
2. Offer features such as:
	* Private channels for teams or departments
	* Public channels for company-wide announcements
	* Direct messaging between users
	* File sharing and collaboration tools
	* Integration with other productivity apps (e.g., Google Drive, Trello)
3. Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure communication.

**AI-Powered Summarization:**

1. Integrate an AI-powered summarization engine that can analyze messages in real-time.
2. Train the AI model using a large dataset of internal company communications, such as emails, meeting notes, and chat logs.
3. Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify key points, entities, and sentiments within each message.
4. Generate a concise summary for each message, highlighting important information, action items, and decisions made.

**Key Features:**

1. **Auto-Summarization:** AI-powered summarization generates a summary for each message in real-time, making it easy to quickly grasp the essence of conversations.
2. **Intelligent Organization:** Use machine learning algorithms to categorize messages based on topics, entities, or sentiment, allowing employees to easily find relevant information.
3. **Contextual Insights:** Analyze conversation history and provide contextual insights to inform future discussions, reducing repetition and improving collaboration.
4. **Action Item Tracking:** Identify key tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities from conversations and track progress in a centralized dashboard.

**Benefits:**

1. **Increased Productivity:** Employees can quickly grasp the essence of conversations and focus on high-priority tasks.
2. **Improved Collaboration:** AI-powered summarization helps team members stay aligned by providing contextual insights and action item tracking.
3. **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Summaries facilitate informed decision-making by providing a clear understanding of discussions and agreements.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. Programming languages: Python, JavaScript
2. Frameworks/ libraries: Flask, React
3. AI/ML frameworks: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
4. Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL
5. Cloud infrastructure: AWS, Google Cloud Platform

This is just a starting point, and there are many ways to customize and enhance this concept. If you're interested in exploring this idea further, I'd be happy to help!
