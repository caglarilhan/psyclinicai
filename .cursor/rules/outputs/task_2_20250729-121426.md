# Görev: Sprint 1 - Randevu takvimi bileşeni ve Firestore bağlantısı

A great start to a project!

**Sprint 1: Randevu Takvimi Bileşeni ve Firestore Bağlantısı**

**Objective:** Create the core components of a scheduling system, including a calendar and integration with Firebase Firestore.

**Task List:**

1. **Design the User Interface (UI) for the scheduling system**: Sketch out the UI components needed for the scheduling system, including:
	* A calendar component to display available dates and times
	* A form to create new appointments or events
	* A list view to display scheduled appointments or events
2. **Set up Firebase Firestore**: Create a new project in Firebase, set up a Firestore database, and enable authentication using Google Sign-In.
3. **Create the Randevu Takvimi Bileşeni (Scheduling Component)**: Implement the scheduling component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
	* Use a library like FullCalendar or DHTMLX Scheduler to create a calendar component that displays available dates and times
	* Add event listeners to allow users to create new appointments or events
	* Integrate the calendar component with Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve appointment data
4. **Implement Data Storage using Firebase Firestore**: Set up data storage in Firestore for storing appointment data, including:
	* Creating a collection for appointments (e.g., "appointments")
	* Defining fields for each appointment document (e.g., date, time, title, description)
5. **Test and Debug the Scheduling Component**: Test the scheduling component to ensure it works as expected, and debug any issues that arise.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The UI design is complete and meets the requirements.
2. Firebase Firestore is set up and integrated with the scheduling system.
3. The scheduling component is implemented and functions correctly.
4. Data storage in Firestore is set up and working properly.
5. The scheduling component is tested and debugged to ensure it works as expected.

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours

By completing this sprint, you'll have a solid foundation for your scheduling system, including a functional calendar component and data storage using Firebase Firestore. This will enable you to build upon the foundation in future sprints.
