# Görev: Sprint 2 - AI destekli reçete öneri modülü (OpenRouter promptları ile)

Sprint 2 for the "AI-supported recipe suggestion module"!

**Objective:**

To develop a module that uses OpenRouter prompts to generate personalized recipe suggestions based on users' cooking preferences, dietary restrictions, and ingredient availability.

**Features:**

1. **User Profiling:** Create a user profile system to store users' cooking preferences, dietary restrictions, and ingredient availability.
2. **Recipe Generation:** Develop an AI-powered recipe generation algorithm that uses OpenRouter prompts to generate personalized recipe suggestions based on the user's profile.
3. **OpenRouter Integration:** Integrate with OpenRouter to access its vast library of recipes and utilize its natural language processing capabilities for generating prompts.
4. **Search and Filter:** Implement a search and filter functionality to allow users to quickly find relevant recipes based on their preferences and dietary restrictions.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **Backend Framework:** Use a backend framework such as Flask or Django to handle API requests and store user data.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilize NLP libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or Stanford CoreNLP for text analysis and OpenRouter prompt generation.
3. **Machine Learning:** Employ machine learning algorithms such as neural networks or decision trees to generate personalized recipe suggestions based on user data.
4. **Database:** Design a database schema to store user profiles, recipes, and ingredient availability.

**Design Considerations:**

1. **Scalability:** Ensure the module can handle a large number of users and recipe suggestions without performance degradation.
2. **Relevance:** Optimize the algorithm to generate highly relevant recipe suggestions based on users' preferences and dietary restrictions.
3. **User Experience:** Design an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily search, filter, and view recipe suggestions.

**Next Steps:**

1. Define the architecture of the module and its integration with OpenRouter.
2. Develop a prototype of the user profiling system and AI-powered recipe generation algorithm.
3. Conduct usability testing and gather feedback from users to refine the design and functionality.

Let's get started on Sprint 2!
