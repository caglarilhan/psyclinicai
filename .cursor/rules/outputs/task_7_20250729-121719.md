# Görev: Sprint 3 - Eğitim paneli UI/UX tasarımı ve AI içerik öneri sistemi

For Sprint 3, I'll provide a UI/UX design concept for the Education Panel and an AI-powered content recommendation system. Here's a detailed proposal:

**Education Panel UI/UX Design:**

Objective: Create an intuitive and engaging user interface for the Education Panel that allows users to access educational resources, track their progress, and receive personalized recommendations.

Design Principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Minimize clutter and focus on essential information.
2. **Intimacy**: Foster a sense of personal connection with users through gamification and rewards.
3. **Personalization**: Tailor the experience to each user's interests, skills, and learning style.
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure easy navigation for users with disabilities.

Wireframes:

**Dashboard**

* Header: Logo, Navigation Menu (Categories), and Search Bar
* Hero Section: Featured Course or Resource, Call-to-Action (CTA) Button
* Course List: Grid or List View of available courses, with filters by Category, Level, and Rating
* Progress Tracker: Visual representation of user progress, including completed lessons and badges earned

**Course Details**

* Overview: Course description, objectives, and prerequisites
* Lessons: List view of individual lessons, with completion status indicators
* Resources: Additional materials for each lesson, such as videos, articles, or podcasts
* Reviews: User reviews and ratings, with filtering options (e.g., by rating or category)

**Recommendations**

* Personalized Recommendations: AI-driven suggestions based on user behavior, interests, and skills
* Category-based Recommendations: Curated lists of courses and resources within specific categories

**Settings**

* Profile Management: User profile information, including goals, interests, and learning style
* Notification Preferences: Control over email, in-app, or push notifications
* Language Settings: Option to change the UI language

Color Scheme:

1. Primary Color: A calming blue (#4567b7)
2. Secondary Color: A vibrant orange (#ff9900) for highlighting and emphasis
3. Background Color: A neutral white (#f7f7f7)

**AI-Powered Content Recommendation System:**

Objective: Develop an AI-powered content recommendation system that suggests relevant educational resources, courses, or activities based on user behavior, interests, and skills.

Algorithm:

1. **User Profiling**: Collect user data, including learning goals, preferences, and behavior patterns.
2. **Content Analysis**: Analyze educational resources, courses, and activities using natural language processing (NLP), topic modeling, and collaborative filtering techniques.
3. **Recommendation Generation**: Use a hybrid approach combining content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to generate personalized recommendations.

Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Relevance**: How well does the recommended content align with the user's interests, goals, and learning style?
2. **Engagement**: Does the recommended content encourage user engagement, such as time spent or completion rates?
3. **Diversity**: Does the recommendation system provide a diverse range of content to avoid monotony and keep users engaged?

By combining these design principles, wireframes, and AI-powered recommendations, we can create an engaging and personalized Education Panel that meets the needs of diverse learners.
