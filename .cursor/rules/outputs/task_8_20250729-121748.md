# Görev: Sprint 4 - Terapi simülasyonu GPT tabanlı modül örneği

Here's an example of a therapy simulation module based on GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):

**Title:** Emotional Regulation Simulation

**Objective:** To help individuals develop emotional regulation skills through a simulated conversation with a therapist.

**Description:**

The Emotional Regulation Simulation is a text-based module that uses GPT to simulate a conversation between the user and a therapist. The user will be presented with a scenario, and their goal will be to regulate their emotions in response to the situation.

**How it works:**

1. The user selects a scenario from a list of options (e.g., public speaking, conflict with a friend, or dealing with a difficult boss).
2. The GPT-based therapist responds to the user's selection with an opening statement, setting the scene for the simulation.
3. The user types their response to the situation, and the GPT-based therapist generates a subsequent response based on the user's input.
4. The simulation continues until the user has successfully regulated their emotions (as determined by the algorithm).
5. Throughout the simulation, the user receives feedback in the form of emotional labels (e.g., anxious, frustrated, or calm) to help them understand their emotional state.

**Example scenario:**

Let's say the user selects the scenario "public speaking." The GPT-based therapist responds with:

"Imagine you're standing in front of a conference room filled with your colleagues. You've been asked to give a presentation on a project you've been working on, and you're feeling anxious about it."

The user types their response, such as: "I'm really nervous about this. I don't want to mess up."

The GPT-based therapist responds with:

"I understand that you're feeling anxious. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel that way?"

And so on.

**Benefits:**

1. **Improved emotional regulation:** The simulation helps users develop skills in identifying, labeling, and managing their emotions.
2. **Increased self-awareness:** Users gain a better understanding of their emotional responses to different situations.
3. **Confidence building:** The simulation provides a safe space for users to practice regulating their emotions without fear of judgment or criticism.

**Technical requirements:**

1. GPT-3 model (or equivalent) for generating therapist responses
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for processing user input and providing emotional labels
3. Database for storing scenarios and user data

This is just one example of a therapy simulation module based on GPT. The possibilities are endless, and the potential benefits to mental health and well-being are significant!
